## Question 1
Explain the 'activity selection problem' by creating a problem of your own. You are free to create any problem, as long as it is similar to a standard activity selection problem.

## Question 2 (programming)
In Python, implement (a) a recursive solution, (b) a dynamic programming solution, (c) a recursive greey solution, and (d) an iterative greedy solution to the following activity selection problem.

i  |  1 |  2 |  3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --  | --
s<sub>i</sub> |  1 |  3 |  0 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 8 | 2 | 12 
f<sub>i</sub> |  4 |  5 |  6 | 7 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 14 | 16

## Question 3 (programming)
The iterative greedy activity selection algorithm has a running time of Ó¨(n). But the algorithm assumes that the activities are sorted by their finish times. If the activities are not sorted, how can we get the algorithm to work? What will be the new running time?

## Question 4
Discuss the difference/s between the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming method with the help of the two versions of the knapsack problem. Include in your discussion how the greedy-choice property holds true only for one of the knapsack problems.

## Question 5 
To solve the activity selection problem, the technique of sorting activities by their number of overlaps and then selecting the activities that have minimum overlaps with other activities, does not work. Illustrate this with a simple example.

## Question 6
When we use prefix codes to encode text, we can simply concatenate the codewords, i.e. we don't need a symbol to separate the codewords. Why doesn't this cause problems when decoding?

## Question 7
The table below represents two methods of encoding (fixed-length and variable-length). Discuss how the variable length encoding saves approximately 25% space.

Character |  a |  b |  c |  d |  e |  f 
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
Frequency | 45 | 13 | 12 | 16 | 9 | 5
Fixed-lenth codeword | 000 | 001 | 010 | 011 | 100 | 101
Variable-length codeword |  0 |  101 | 100 | 111 | 1101 | 1100

## Question 8
Create a string by concatenating your first name, middle name and last name. Use the Huffman coding algorithm to create a codeword for each of the letter in your name. Start by creating a frequency table of letters such that the characters are ordered by their frequency. Most importantly, show the steps of the Huffman's algorithm by displaying how the Huffman (binary) tree grows after each step. How many bits are be required for encoding your name? How many bits would it require if we were to use fixed-length codeword?

## Question 9 
What is the optimal Huffman code for the following set of frequencies, based on the first n Fibonacci numbers? show the steps of the Huffman's algorithm by displaying how the Huffman (binary) tree grows after each step. Optionally, you can also use the Python code below to verify your answer. (from CLRS 16.3-3)
```
a:1 b:1 c:2 d:3 e:5 f:8 g:13 h:21
```

## Question 10 (programming)
The file [reddit_relationshipadvice_legaladvice_2000](./reddit_relationshipadvice_legaladvice_2000.txt) contains the texts of legal relationship advice obtained from Reddit. Compres the file using the Huffman's algorithm implemented below. Extend the code to read the file and write the compressed file. How will you verify that the codewords make sense (i.e. roughly correct)?

# Python implementation of the Huffman's algorithm 
```python
import heapq

def huffman_encode(frequency):
    heap = [[weight, [symbol, '']] for symbol, weight in frequency.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    while len(heap) > 1:
        lo = heapq.heappop(heap)
        hi = heapq.heappop(heap)
        for pair in lo[1:]:
            pair[1] = '0' + pair[1]
        for pair in hi[1:]:
            pair[1] = '1' + pair[1]
        heapq.heappush(heap, [lo[0] + hi[0]] + lo[1:] + hi[1:])
    return sorted(heapq.heappop(heap)[1:], key=lambda p: (len(p[-1]), p))

data = 'aaccbaaaaaaaaddaaabdebacbaafabaadaaadacabdaefcaaeeaabfdcaaecbbbadafeaaaadadfbdcdabdeccdcadaadbaeaaec'
print('Data:')
print(data)

from collections import defaultdict
frequency = defaultdict(int)

for symbol in data:
    frequency[symbol] += 1

print('')
print('Symbol frequencies:')
print(frequency)

huff = huffman_encode(frequency)

print('')
print('Huffman codes:')
for p in huff:
    print (p[0], str(frequency[p[0]]), p[1])
```
```
Data:
aaccbaaaaaaaaddaaabdebacbaafabaadaaadacabdaefcaaeeaabfdcaaecbbbadafeaaaadadfbdcdabdeccdcadaadbaeaaec

Symbol frequencies:
defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'a': 45, 'c': 12, 'b': 13, 'd': 16, 'e': 9, 'f': 5})

Huffman codes:
a 45 0
b 13 101
c 12 100
d 16 111
e 9 1101
f 5 1100
```

## Optional Question (not for bonus points)
