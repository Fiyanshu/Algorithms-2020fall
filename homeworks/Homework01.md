# Question 1
Reorder the following terms from lowest to highest time complexity, using ‘<’ between terms. If two terms have the same complexity, use an equal sign instead. Assume n > 1 and ‘k’ is a constant. Note that not all terms are shown in their most reduced forms.
- O(n<sup>2</sup>)    
- O(kn)  
- O(1)  
- O(100000 * n)  
- O(n!)  
- O(lg n)  - lg is log2  
- O(2n)  
- O(n)  
- O(k lg n)  
- O(n <sup>100000</sup>)  
- O(n * lg n)  

# Question 2 (CLRS 3.1-3)
- Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm A is at least O(n<sup>2</sup>)," is meaningless.

# Question 3 (CLRS 3.1-4)
- Is 2<sup>n+1</sup> = O(2<sup>n</sup>)? Explain.  
- Is 2<sup>2n</sup> = O(2<sup>n</sup>)? Explain.
